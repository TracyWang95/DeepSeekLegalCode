# DeepSeekCode

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

A local CLI coding agent adapted from the Claude Code codebase, routing model requests to DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible API.

> Community fork, not an official DeepSeek or Anthropic product.

## Features

- Project-aware chat with tool execution and permission prompts
- **Thinking mode** with configurable effort levels (low / high / max)
- File editing, sub-agents, MCP support, and `-p` non-interactive mode
- 1M context window, up to 384K output tokens
- Local config isolation under `.deepseek-code`

## Quick Start

Install globally from npm:

```bash
npm install -g @qingj/deepseekcode
```

Set your DeepSeek API key:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Windows CMD:

```cmd
setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

Open a new terminal, then run DeepSeekCode from any project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
deepseekcode
```

The equivalent command is also available:

```bash
deepseek-code
```

One-shot mode:

```bash
deepseek-code -p "summarize this repository"
```

## Legal Plugins

DeepSeekCode includes a helper for Anthropic's `claude-for-legal` marketplace.
This repository also ships `.deepseek/settings.json` with `claude-for-legal`
pre-registered and all 12 core legal workflows enabled by default.
For lawyers, the normal path is just: set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, start
DeepSeekCode, and use the preinstalled legal workflows.

Install another workflow while keeping model traffic on DeepSeek:

```bash
deepseek-code legal setup commercial-legal
```

List supported legal workflows:

```bash
deepseek-code legal list
```

Check installation state:

```bash
deepseek-code legal doctor
```

See [DeepSeek Legal Plugins](docs/legal-plugins.md) for available workflows,
the [integration design](docs/legal-integration-design.md) for architecture,
and [中文指南](docs/legal-plugins.zh-CN.md) for Chinese documentation.

## Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QingJ01/DeepSeekCode.git
cd DeepSeekCode
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
```

Run the local source checkout:

```bash
node scripts/run-deepseek.mjs
```

## Model Aliases

| Alias | DeepSeek Model |
|-------|---------------|
| `pro` | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| `flash` | `deepseek-v4-flash` |

Legacy Claude aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `best`) are still supported.

## How It Works

- Routes API calls through a DeepSeek adapter using the Anthropic SDK
- Thinking mode enabled by default with `max` effort
- Temperature is ignored server-side when thinking is active (0.0-2.0 supported in non-thinking mode)
- Automatic prefix caching is handled server-side by DeepSeek; tools are sorted alphabetically to maximize cache hits
- Costs displayed in CNY (¥); `/cost` shows cache hit rate and savings
- Converts unsupported content blocks (image, document, server-tool) to text placeholders
- Sub-agents inherit all DeepSeek environment variables

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Generated directories (`dist/`, `build-src/`) are git-ignored.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Development workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QingJ01/DeepSeekCode.git
cd DeepSeekCode
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check          # Build and verify
npm test               # Run test suite
```
